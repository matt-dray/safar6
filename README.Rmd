## Summary 

Work in progress: an R package containing an [R6](https://r6.r-lib.org/) class to simulate simplified gameplay elements of [the Safari Zone](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Kanto_Safari_Zone) sub-area from [_Pokémon Blue_](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Generation_I) (1998) with OOP.

The first generation of _Pokémon_ games were developed for [the Nintendo Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy) by [Game Freak](https://www.gamefreak.co.jp/) and published by [Nintendo](https://www.nintendo.com). Pokémon as a property is owned by [The Pokémon Company](https://www.pokemon.co.jp/).

This project is a demonstration of [the {R6} package](https://r6.r-lib.org/) and the R6-class for object-oriented programming in R. It's purely for learning purposes.

## Play

Install from GitHub with `remotes::install_github("matt-dray/safar6")`.

Initialise with e.g. `sz <- safar6::SafariZone$new()`.

`sz$step()` to take a step in the Safari Zone. There's an x% chance you'll encounter a Pokémon. The species and level of that Pokémon are based on an encounter rate. You'll be prompted to throw a Safari Ball, throw bait, throw a rock or run. Bait and rocks influence catch rates. The Pokémon's level and HP also influence catchability. Try to catch as many Pokémon as you can before you run out of steps or balls.

`sz$pause()` to 'pause' the game and see current stats.

For help with fields and methods see `?safar6::SafariZone`.

## Details

### The Safari Zone

The Safari Zone is an enclosed area separate from the rest of the game. Game mechanics are different here: you're allowed 500 steps and 30 balls to capture Pokémon. Also, wild encounters don't result in a 'battle'; instead you can 'bait' or 'throw a rock' to influence the catch rate of the target.

### Technicals

The fields in the `SafariZone` class are 'overworld' counters: number of steps remaining, number of balls remaining and number of captures made.

Methods are:

* `$pause()` (a copy of the `$print()` method) to simulate the pause screen from the game, showing the current number of steps and balls remaining
* `$step()`, which moves your 'player' and may result in an encounter

The `$step()` method contains code that:

* decides whether you encountered a target, based on the encounter rate of the Safari Zone
* selects the wild Pokémon, based on the relative encounter rate for the Safari Zone Center Area, and generates some IVs
* prompts you for an action
* calculates your chance of capture if you throw a ball
* influences the 'angry' and 'eating' values of the target
* calculates the chance the target will flee at the end of each turn, based on fields like catch rate, HP, speed, anger and eating status

TODO:

* "New POKeDEX data will be added for [x]."
* "Do you want to give a nickname to [x]?"
* "[x] was transferred to BILL's PC!"
* BILL's PC
* IVs
* wobble
* an Easter egg...

### Not included

This implementation doesn't include a number of features from the original. Some missing elements are:

* visuals (everything is printed in the console)
* movement around a map (all steps are treated as though you're moving through tall grass)
* all areas of the Safari Zone (Center, East, West and North)
* fishing and use of different rod types
* species and catch and encounter rates from the other Gen 1 versions (_Red_ and _Yellow_)

## Sources

Information about game mechanics and values are relatively tricky to come by. I used the following resources:

* [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/) for Pokémon stats
* [The Cave of Dragonflies](https://www.dragonflycave.com/) for explanations of game mechanics
* The [pret/pokered GitHub repo](https://github.com/pret/pokered) for a dissassembly of the games
* The [Pokémon Slots](https://sites.google.com/site/pokemonslots) website for encounter rates

I also referred to a post I wrote about [using {R6} to simulate an Automatic Bell Dispenser](https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/04/04/repaying-tom-nook-with-r6/) from Nintendo's _Animal Crossing: New Horizons_ (2020).
