## Summary 

Work in progress: an R package containing an [R6](https://r6.r-lib.org/) class to simulate simplified gameplay elements of [the Safari Zone](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Kanto_Safari_Zone) sub-area from [_Pokémon Blue_](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Generation_I) (1998) with OOP.

The first generation of _Pokémon_ games were developed for [the Nintendo Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy) by [Game Freak](https://www.gamefreak.co.jp/) and published by [Nintendo](https://www.nintendo.com). Pokémon as a property is owned by [The Pokémon Company](https://www.pokemon.co.jp/).

This project is a demonstration of [the {R6} package](https://r6.r-lib.org/) and the R6-class for object-oriented programming in R. It's purely for learning purposes.

## Use

Install with `remotes::install_github("matt-dray/safar6")`. Initialise with `sz <- safar6::SafariZone$new()` and access methods like `sz$pause()` and `sz$step()`. For help with fields and methods see `?SafariZone`.

## Details

### The Safari Zone

The Safari Zone is an enclosed area separate from the rest of the game. Game mechanics are different here: you're allowed 500 steps and 30 balls to capture Pokémon. Also, wild encounters don't result in a 'battle'; instead you can 'bait' or 'throw a rock' to influence the catch rate of the target.

### Technicals

There are two types of field in the class:

* 'overworld' counters: number of steps remaining, number of balls remaining, number of captures made
* encounter-related states (which are refreshed at the start of an encounter and modified throughout): species, level, HP, speed, catch rate, and angry and eating statuses 

The fields are `private`; they shouldn't be influenced from outside the class.

Methods are:

* `$pause()` (a copy of the `$print()` method) to simulate the pause screen from the game, showing the current number of steps and balls remaining
* `$step()`, which moves your 'player' and may result in an encounter

The `$step()` method contains code that:

* decides whether you encountered a target, based on the encounter rate of the Safari Zone

Todo implement my pre-written `$step()` code that:

* selects the wild Pokémon, based on the relative encounter rate for the Safari Zone Center Area, and generates some IVs
* prompts you for an action
* calculates your chance of capture if you throw a ball
* influences the 'angry' and 'eating' values of the target
* calculates the chance the target will flee at the end of each turn, based on fields like catch rate, HP, speed, anger and eating status

### Not included

This implementation doesn't include a number of features from the original. Some missing elements are:

* visuals (everything is printed in the console)
* movement around a map (all steps are treated as though you're moving through tall grass)
* all areas of the Safari Zone (Center, East, West and North)
* fishing and use of different rod types
* species and catch and encounter rates from the other Gen 1 versions (_Red_ and _Yellow_)

## Sources

Information about game mechanics and values are relatively tricky to come by. I used the following resources:

* [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/) for Pokémon stats
* [The Cave of Dragonflies](https://www.dragonflycave.com/) for explanations of game mechanics
* The [pret/pokered GitHub repo](https://github.com/pret/pokered) for a dissassembly of the games
* The [Pokémon Slots](https://sites.google.com/site/pokemonslots) website for encounter rates

I also referred to a post I wrote about [using {R6} to simulate an Automatic Bell Dispenser](https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/04/04/repaying-tom-nook-with-r6/) from Nintendo's _Animal Crossing: New Horizons_ (2020).
