## Summary 

Work in progress: an R package containing an [R6](https://r6.r-lib.org/) class to simulate simplified gameplay elements of [the Safari Zone](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Kanto_Safari_Zone) sub-area from [_Pokémon Blue_](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Generation_I) (1998) with OOP.

The first generation of _Pokémon_ games were developed for [the Nintendo Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy) by [Game Freak](https://www.gamefreak.co.jp/) and published by [Nintendo](https://www.nintendo.com). Pokémon as a property is owned by [The Pokémon Company](https://www.pokemon.co.jp/).

This project is a demonstration of [the {R6} package](https://r6.r-lib.org/) and the R6-class for object-oriented programming in R. It's purely for learning purposes.

## Basic gameplay

Install from GitHub with `remotes::install_github("matt-dray/safar6")`.

The game is text-based and takes place entirely in the console. Start a game like `x <- safar6::SafariZone$new()`. Be warned: it's tricky. But then so was the original.

Use `x$step()` to take a step through the tall grass of the Safari Zone. There's a chance you'll encounter a wild Pokémon; perhaps it will be a rare one at a high level. You'll be prompted to throw a Safari Ball to try and catch it, with the option to throw bait or a rock to influence its catchability. Try to catch as many Pokémon as you can before you run out of steps or balls.

Use `x$pause()` to 'pause' the game and see your current stats. You can boot up `x$bills_pc` to see which Pokémon you've caught so far. 

For help with fields and methods see `?safar6::SafariZone`.

## Details

### The Safari Zone

The [Safari Zone](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Kanto_Safari_Zone) is an enclosed area separate from the rest of the game. Game mechanics are different here: you're allowed 500 steps and 30 balls to capture Pokémon. Also, wild encounters don't result in a 'battle'; instead you can 'bait' or 'throw a rock' to influence the catch rate of the target. I chose to simulate this area due to its relative simplicity compared to other areas of the game, which use a more complex battle mechanic.

### Technicals

The fields in the `SafariZone` class are 'overworld' counters, basically: the number of steps and balls remaining, and the number and identity of captures you've made.

Methods are:

* `$new()` to initialise the class and start the game
* `$step()`, which moves your 'player' and may result in an encounter
* `$pause()` (a copy of the `$print()` method) to simulate the pause screen from the game, showing the current number of steps and balls remaining

The `$step()` method does the hard work. It contains code that:

* decides whether you encountered a target, based on the encounter rate of the Safari Zone (~12%)
* selects a wild Pokémon based on the relative encounter-rate slots for the Safari Zone Center Area particular to _Pokémon Blue_ (e.g. 20% for a level 22 Nidoran Female through to 1% for a level 23 Chansey; see `safar6::pokemon` for details)
* generates individual variation in the selected Pokémon's speed and HP (IV values), which influence catchability
* prompts you interactively for an action: throw ball, bait, throw rock, run
* adjusts the 'angry' and 'eating' values of the target and modifies catch rate and run probability as a result (a rock doubles the catch rate and the flee chance; bait halves the catch rate, but makes it four times less likely to run)
* calculates whether the Pokémon will be caught or will run away
* terminates the game if steps or balls are depleted

## Omissions

To keep things (much!) simpler than the original, this implementation doesn't include a number of features from the original game. Some missing elements are:

* visuals (everything is printed in the console)
* movement around a map (all steps are treated as though you're moving through tall grass)
* all areas of the Safari Zone (only the Center area is used here)
* finding items (they have no use in this context)
* fishing and use of different rod types
* species catch and encounter rates from the other Gen 1 versions (e.g. Scyther is in _Red_ rather than Pinsir; and _Yellow_ has some catch-rate changes)

## Sources

Information about game mechanics and values are relatively tricky to come by. I used the following resources:

* [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/) for Pokémon stats and game mechanics
* [The Cave of Dragonflies](https://www.dragonflycave.com/) for game mechanics
* the [Pokémon Slots](https://sites.google.com/site/pokemonslots) website for encounter rates
* the [pret/pokered GitHub repo](https://github.com/pret/pokered) for a disassembly of the games

I also referred to a post I wrote about [using {R6} to simulate an Automatic Bell Dispenser](https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/04/04/repaying-tom-nook-with-r6/) from Nintendo's _Animal Crossing: New Horizons_ (2020).
